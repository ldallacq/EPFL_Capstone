1097904082335854592,2019-02-19 17:01:45+00:00,"So, as always, don’t believe everything you read and see online. I don’t have any relationships with these sites. I’m not leaking my looks to anyone, and I don’t support what these companies are doing."
1097903979885805568,2019-02-19 17:01:21+00:00,"I often plan for weeks, sometimes months, and even a year in advance, and I’m grateful for every fashion moment those designers and their dresses have helped me create."
1097903956150210562,2019-02-19 17:01:15+00:00,My relationships with designers are very important to me. It's taken me over a decade to build them and I have a huge amount of respect for the amount of work that they put into bringing their ideas to life.
1097903715493720064,2019-02-19 17:00:18+00:00,This is a way to get people to sign up for their mailing list and make people believe there is some kind of relationship between me and this fashion site. There is not.
1097903684527091712,2019-02-19 17:00:11+00:00,"Only two days ago, I was privileged enough to wear a one-of-a-kind vintage Mugler dress and in less than 24 hours it was knocked off and thrown up on a site - but it's not for sale. You have to sign up for a waitlist because the dress hasn’t even been made to sell yet."
1097903657377361922,2019-02-19 17:00:04+00:00,"I’ve watched these companies profit off my husband’s work for years and now that it’s also affecting designers who have been so generous to give me access to their beautiful works, I can no longer sit silent."
1097903481518616576,2019-02-19 16:59:22+00:00,"It’s devastating to see these fashion companies rip off designs that have taken the blood, sweat and tears of true designers who have put their all into their own original ideas."
1097877351755476992,2019-02-19 15:15:32+00:00,We lost a true legend! You were such an inspiration to the world! You shot my first fashion shoot &amp; I was so nervous to work w such an icon!

1000840705089200128,2018-05-27 20:46:33+00:00,I have and will always applaud any efforts to give back to the community. To fight for justice and to help uplift the youth. But I will never tolerate someone who was close to Kanye who attempts to use his late mother’s name to publicly shame him while pretending to do good.
1000840335080108032,2018-05-27 20:45:05+00:00,"Kanye gave his “friend” an opportunity to run an organization on his own. So now that Kanye is being publicly shamed for not being involved makes no sense and,  at this exact time, just seems very calculated."
1000840204352086016,2018-05-27 20:44:34+00:00,"After several years of lack of performance from the organization and Kanye going through personal financial issues, he could no longer fund salaries. Rhymefest asked to take it over and Kanye agreed with no financial strings attached."
1000839970465112064,2018-05-27 20:43:38+00:00,"Kanye and Donda started  a charity called Loop Dreams. When Donda passed, they changed the name to Donda’s House. Kanye paid Rhymefest a salary to run it."

1000518355571298304,2018-05-26 23:25:39+00:00,U haven’t been right since u got kicked out of the studio in Hawaii wearing fake Yeezy’s @RHYMEFEST 😂 You’re over levergenging Kanye’s name &amp; asked Kanye to donate money to u so stop w your fake community politics &amp; lies.

989227725935144961,2018-04-25 19:40:43+00:00,Mental Health is no joke and the media needs to stop spitting that out so casually. Bottom line
989225226490687488,2018-04-25 19:30:47+00:00,Kanye will never run in the race of popular opinion and we know that and that’s why I love him and respect him and in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren’t labeled the way he is  and you will all praise them! Kanye is years ahead of his time
989225120282558464,2018-04-25 19:30:22+00:00,"Now when he spoke out about Trump... Most people (including myself) have very different feelings &amp; opinions about this. But this is HIS opinion.  I believe in people being able to have their own opinions,even if really different from mine
He never said he agrees with his politics"
989221660661137408,2018-04-25 19:16:37+00:00,"He’s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America? Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That’s just not fair. He’s actually out of the sunken place when he’s being himself which is very expressive"
989220992235941889,2018-04-25 19:13:58+00:00,Yesterday it was announced that Kanye had parted ways with some business people and media outlets made this about Kanye’s mental health. Rather than just a simple business decision. So I’m glad he tweeted about the state of his company and all of the exciting things happening
989220790741553152,2018-04-25 19:13:10+00:00,To the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this... your commentary on Kanye being erratic &amp; his tweets being disturbing is actually scary. So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair

879835812380065792,2017-06-27 22:56:18+00:00,When I uploaded the album I was tagging everyone that came to the party and for some reason it wouldn’t let me tag Jackie’s name.
879835774211956736,2017-06-27 22:56:09+00:00,I would never post someone’s pic on my page and then intentionally not tag them.
879835649104199680,2017-06-27 22:55:39+00:00,I just saw a story saying I intentionally didn’t tag @jackieaina in a pic I posted on Instagram because of a review she did about my line.
